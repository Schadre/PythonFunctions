""" 
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to create a program 
that helps users make a shopping list.

Task 1: Write a function that lets the user add items to a list.

Task 2: Include a function to remove items from the list.

Task 3: Add a function that prints out the entire list in a formatted way.

Note: The goal of this is to be a program. The recommendation is to use a 
while loop that will allow the user to continue to add, remove, and print off 
their shopping list until they decide to "quit", also known as breaking the loop.
